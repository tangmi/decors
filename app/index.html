	<h1>decors</h1>
	<p>This is a response to the frustation from running into CORS issues in cross-domain ajax calls. Decors simply acts as a proxy for you while you begin the development of your webapp (you probably don't want to use this when you go to production).</p>
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<p>Perhaps if you are co-developing with a partner and he/she is working on the backend. If you are on the same network, you can access their IP address and pick up their changes in real-time. It's like CO-OP development.</p>
	<p>Decors also speeds up your development marginally by providing middleware that reloads your page in the browser as you make changes to it.</p>
	<h2>How to run</h2>
	<p>There's two ways of running decors. Go into the <code>./decors</code> directory and run <code>npm install</code>, then pick one:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Run <code>npm start</code> (or <code>./node_modules/.bin/grunt</code>)</li>
		<li>Install <code>grunt-cli</code>, then run <code>grunt</code>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You'll see your browser open a window pointed at <code>http://localhost:9000/</code> and you can start developing your app in <code>./app</code>! Whenever you want to make a non-local request, just prepend the url with <code>/_decors/</code>.</p>
	<h2>Example</h2>
	<p>Downloaded from:<br><code id="url"></code></p>
	<pre id="example"></pre>

	<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script>
		var url = 'http://localhost:9000/_decors/' + 'http://www.google.com/';
		$('#url').text(url);
		$.ajax(url).done(function(data) {
			$('#example').text(data);
		});
	</script>
